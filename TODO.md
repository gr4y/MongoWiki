# TODOs

- Tests

## Features 

- article versioning and locking
- implement an export and import mechanism for articles into markdown
- add an markdown editor, maybe [pagedown](http://pagedown.googlecode.com/)?

## Enhancements

- replace sprockets cause it's just plain annoying to deal with!
- migrate from erb to an much more readable template engine. ([slim](http://slim-lang.com) looks very promising)
- migrate from sinatra.rb to [happy.rb](https://github.com/hmans/happy)
